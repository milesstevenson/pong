# Pong #

This is a clone of the game, Pong, to get familiar with Python and Pygame.



Requirements: [Python 3.3](http://www.python.org/getit/releases/3.3.0/) and [Pygame 1.9 for Python 3.3](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads). It seems that although previous versions of the latter have been usable on both Windows and Linux, currently this version is only usable in Windows.

## Current Features ##
* Bouncing ball sprite across the screen
* Visible first bat, with some user movement taken

## Still To Be Done ##
* User movement through the bat sprite
* Proper collision handling between the bat and ball sprites
* Point system and proper updates to said system once a ball passes the opponent
* Simple AI for the opposing bat
  * Different levels of difficulty of said AI -- easy, medium, hard
* Some sort of game menu interface
