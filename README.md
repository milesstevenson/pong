# Pong #

This is a clone of the game, Pong, to get familiar with Python and Pygame.



### Requirements ###
[Python 3.3](http://www.python.org/getit/releases/3.3.0/) and [Pygame 1.9 for Python 3.3](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads). It seems that although previous versions of the latter have been usable on both Windows and Linux, currently this version is only usable in Windows.

## Current Features ##
* Bouncing ball sprite across the screen
* User movement through the bat sprite
* Acceptable collision handling between bat and ball sprites
* Point system and some updates to the system, depending on what the ball does.
* Beatable AI for opposing bat

## Still To Be Done ##
* Fix the point system to restart the game after a player gets 10 points -- currently crashes at 10 poins.
* Possibly implement different levels of difficulty of said AI -- easy, medium, hard
* Some sort of game menu interface
